          Thanks for dropping by! I've recently graduated from
           <a href="http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/"> Nashville Software School</a>, a six month,
           intensive, thirty-five hour a week, coding bootcamp. While I was there I learned all about the
           magic that is software develpment. I also learned a lot about myself.I experienced
           months of front end develpment & three months of back end develpment.
           In the fourth month I was introduced to Ruby, I quickly fell in love. I'm
           seeking a thoughtful, passionate team to help me hone my new craft.
